## Introduction

This project implements a Telegram bot for Grab Talent, allowing users to sign up as candidates by providing their email and uploading their resume. The bot notifies admins in a Telegram group when a new resume is submitted and logs user interactions for analysis and troubleshooting. Additionally, an admin dashboard is provided for updating the message configurations used by the bot.

## Code Explanation

### Main Bot (`main.mjs`)

The main bot script handles the core functionalities of the bot, including user interactions, resume submissions, and logging.

### Admin Dashboard (`admin.js`)

The admin dashboard script sets up a web server using Express.js, allowing admins to update the message configurations via a web interface.

### Message Configuration (`messageConfig.mjs`)

This file contains the messages used by the bot. It exports an object with different message templates.

```javascript
export const MESSAGES = {
    welcome: [
        'Hello and welcome to Grab Talent! ðŸ‘‹',
        'We're thrilled to have you here. Let's get you started on your journey to exciting career opportunities. Please provide your email address to create your account.'
    ],
    emailPrompt: [
        'Thank you! We've received your email: {email}. âœ…',
        'Next, please upload your resume (PDF, DOCX, etc.) to complete your account setup. We're excited to learn more about you!'
    ],
    invalidEmail: 'Oops! The email address you provided seems to be invalid. ðŸš« Please double-check and try again. We want to ensure we can reach you!',
    invalidFile: 'The file you uploaded is not a valid resume format or exceeds the size limit. Please upload a PDF or DOCX file not larger than 2MB.',
    uploadResume: 'Great! Now, please upload your resume (PDF, DOCX, etc.) to complete your account setup. ðŸ“„ We're eager to see your qualifications and help you find the best opportunities!',
    success: [
        'Your resume has been successfully received and forwarded to our team at Grab Talent! ðŸŽ‰',
        'Thank you for using our service. We're excited to help you on your career journey!'
    ],
    error: 'Oops! Something went wrong while processing your file. ðŸ˜” Please try uploading your resume again. If the issue persists, contact our support team for assistance.',
    emailUsed: 'It looks like the email address you provided has already been used. ðŸ”„ Please use a different email address to continue. We're here to help if you need any assistance!',
};
```

## Error Handling

- The bot handles various error scenarios, such as invalid email format, invalid file type, and file size exceeding the limit.
- Errors encountered during file download, email sending, and logging are caught and logged appropriately.

## Logging

- Logs user interactions and submission statistics for analysis and troubleshooting.
- Uses a JSON file to store logs, capturing details such as email address, file name, submission status, and admin notification status.

## Future Improvements

- Add user authentication for the admin dashboard.
- Enhance the logging mechanism to include more detailed analytics.
- Implement automated tests for the bot and the admin dashboard.
